All New Hampshire coastal waters are designated as a No-
Discharge Zone (NDZ). Under the Clean Water Act, Section 
312, all vessels operating within a No-Discharge Zone are 
completely prohibited from discharging any sewage, treated or 
untreated, into the waters. All vessels with an installed marine 
sanitation device (MSD) that are navigating, moored, anchored 
or docked within a NDZ must have the MSD disabled to prevent 
the overboard discharge of sewage (treated or untreated) or 
install a holding tank. Regulations for the NDZ are contained in 
the U.S. Coast Pilot. Additional information concerning the 
regulations and requirements may be obtained from the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) web site:
